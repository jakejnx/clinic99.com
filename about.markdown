<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>We are working to build new software to help manage a sexual health, contracption and HIV service on a national platform.  The need for better software in this feild is clear from using some of the systems on the market at present and we are engaging many experts across the UK to help ensure the end product fits many local clinics need.</p>
<p>Information is cureently not easily shared between clinics.  This may be down to issues with technology rather than obtaining consent.  We believe most patients would expect a joined up system allowing them to recieve the best care wherever they attend an NHS clinic in the UK.</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p> Quality is at the centre of what we do, we want to engage all staff accross the country with a balanced approach to building software that simply works, is easy to use and allows clinical staff to focus on the patient, not the PC.</p>
<p>We are not yet registered as a company.  But we believe in building the best software and not largely focussing on profit.  We want to provide unrivaled support to our customers and proove they can trust us to safely provide our service.</p>
